      <div class="question">
        <strong>Q1:</strong>Draw a chart where the X axis is time and the Y axis is voltage. Draw 3 lines representing the voltage across an LED with analogWrite(led, 64), analogWrite(led, 128), and analogWrite(led, 255).

      <div class="question">
        <strong>Q2:</strong> Given your schematic, circuit, and firmware, assuming the only thing that draws current is your LEDs, how long would your circuit run if powered by a 1200 mAh battery?
        <br>
        <strong>A:</strong>
        <p>Battery = 1200mAh, I = 20mA, 3LEDs<br>
        Hours = 1200mAh / 20mA x 3<br>
        Hours = 20 <br>
          <br>
        A 1200mAh battery could power my circuit for 20 hours total.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="question">
        <strong>Q3:</strong> Measure and record the actual voltage across one of your LEDs when it's on. How does this compare to the theoretical forward voltage for your LED color?
        <br>
        <strong>A:</strong> The actual voltage across my red LED when it was on was around 1.8 V. This is a bit less than the theoretical forward voltage listed on the LED's spec sheet.
