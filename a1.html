      <div class="question">
          <strong>Q2:</strong> How many LEDs could you blink independently with your Arduino? How much current would that draw?
          <br>
          <strong>A:</strong> The max number of LEDs that I was able to control with the arduino was 12. This is because there are only 12 digital ports on the arduino.
      </div>
      <div class="question">
          <strong>Q4:</strong> How fast do you need to blink your LEDs until you no longer can tell that they are blinking?
          <br>
          <strong>A:</strong> I had to set the delay time to 12ms for the blinking of the LED to be discernible.
      </div>
      <div class="question">
          <strong>Q5:</strong>  Did you use AI tools in completing this assignment? If yes, please provide details on how/when, as well as a brief reflection. If no, you can either leave this question blank, or provide other information if you'd like.
          <br>
          <strong>A:</strong> I used AI tools to help me format some of the items in this documentation. Specifically, I googled the way I wanted something formatted and if an AI summary that sounded similar to what I was looking for came up, I would look at it and take the parts of the code that it gave me that I needed to use. Strangely, it felt pretty good to use AI this way, because I didn't feel like I was being given the answers and instead could read and understand what it was giving me, and take from there.
